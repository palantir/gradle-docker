Code Style
----------
When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as
readable as possible. We realize that the style used in this project might be different that what is used in your
projects, but in the end it makes it easier to merge changes and maintain in the future.


Testing
-------
We kindly ask that all new features and fixes for an issue should include any unit tests. Even if it is small
improvement, adding a unit test will help to ensure no regressions or the issue is not re-introduced. If you need help
with writing a test for your feature, please don't be shy and ask!


Documentation
-------------
Up-to-date documentation makes all our lives easier. If you are adding a new feature, enhancing an existing feature, or
fixing an issue, please add or modify the documentation as needed and include it with your pull request.
